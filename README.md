The data was used to generate tables and figures in the paper. 

## Contents

* [bibliography.bib](bibliography.bib): The bibliography as used in the LaTeX project. Contains references not only for
  surveyed papers, but for other work too.
* [data.json](data.json): Metadata on the reviewed papers featured in the survey. 
* [index.html](index.html): a master table, compiled from the [data.json](data.json) file, that shows all collected 
  information on reviewed papers.

## Installation

This repository uses Python and [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) in order to run - but it 
probably also runs on virtualenv.

### If using Anaconda

1. Create a new environment:
